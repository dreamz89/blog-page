This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Requirements

There are three requirements:

- The application must be built using React.
- It should utilize Ant Design (https://ant.design/).
- It should be implemented with TypeScript.

We’re particularly interested in your frontend skills, so you won’t need to worry about mocking an API.
Feel free to use a publicly available API, such as jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

## Setup

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
